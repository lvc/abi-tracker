NAME:
  ABI Tracker - visualize ABI changes timeline of a C/C++ software library.
  
  The tool requires input profile of the library in JSON format. It can be created manually or automatically generated by the ABI Monitor: https://github.com/lvc/abi-monitor
  
  Sample report: http://abi-laboratory.pro/tracker/timeline/glib/
  
  The tool is developed by Andrey Ponomarenko. Please consider to add ABI Viewer reports for visualization of the ABI structure and high detailed binary compatibility analysis: http://abi-laboratory.pro/

INSTALL:
  sudo make install prefix=/usr

REQUIRES:
  Perl 5 (5.8 or newer)
  Elfutils
  ABI Dumper (0.99.9 or newer)
  Vtable-Dumper (1.1 or newer)
  ABI Compliance Checker (1.99.10 or newer)
  PkgDiff (1.6.4 or newer)
  RfcDiff (1.41 or newer)
  
  You can use the installer (https://github.com/lvc/installer) to automatically download and install most of the required tools.

USAGE:
  abi-tracker [options] [profile]
  
  The input profile can be generated by the ABI Monitor tool. All manual edits in the profile will be preserved after re-generating it by the ABI Monitor.
  
  The home page of the output report is: timeline/LIB_NAME/index.html
  
EXAMPLES:
  abi-tracker -build libssh.json
  abi-tracker -rebuild -target abireport -v 0.7.0 libssh.json
